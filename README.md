This project was implemented for the course called Application Engineering and Development.

In this project I have,

•	Engineered a Java Swing application using real-time data to analyze the effects on users’ vital signs based on the nutrients consumed throughout the day.
•	Endeavored to create an application that aligns with the concept of Internet of Things.
